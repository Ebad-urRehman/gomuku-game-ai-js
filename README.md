# Game name
I don't know the game name. My brother tell me the game rules and I want to make an AI for that in javascript using Search algorithms A*, minimax and few others, I recently haven't implement any algorithm yet exept BFS, DFS for searching.

# Game ui is made a little bit for now

# Any Suggestions you can give
Some backend is also implemented 

I give all blocks numbers from 1 to 25. and store connected blocks in a dictionary.

connected nodes appear green when I select any node in the program.

but I am also new to javascript so the problem is how to select a node, I mean making an area within canvas clickable.
